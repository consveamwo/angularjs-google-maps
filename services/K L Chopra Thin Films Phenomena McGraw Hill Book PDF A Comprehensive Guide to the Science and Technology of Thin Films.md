# Review of Thin Film Phenomena by Kasturi L. Chopra
 
Thin Film Phenomena is a classic textbook on the science and technology of thin films, written by Kasturi L. Chopra, a former professor of physics at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. The book was first published in 1969 by McGraw-Hill and later reprinted in 1979 by R. E. Krieger Publishing Company. The book covers various aspects of thin film formation, characterization, and applications, with an emphasis on physical principles and experimental techniques.
 
The book consists of 28 chapters, organized into six parts: Introduction, Thickness Measurement and Analytical Techniques, Growth and Structure of Thin Films, Electrical Properties of Thin Films, Optical Properties of Thin Films, and Miscellaneous Topics. The book provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamentals of thin film phenomena, such as nucleation, coalescence, epitaxy, diffusion, defects, stress, and domain walls. It also discusses various methods of thin film deposition, such as evaporation, sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, and electroplating. The book describes various techniques for measuring and analyzing thin film thickness, composition, structure, morphology, electrical conductivity, resistivity, optical reflectivity, transmittance, absorption, and emission. The book also explores various applications of thin films in electronics, optics, magnetics, catalysis, corrosion protection, and coatings.

One of the strengths of the book is its extensive coverage of various thin film phenomena and techniques, which makes it a comprehensive and authoritative source of information. The book also provides many examples and case studies of thin film applications in various fields, which illustrate the practical relevance and importance of thin film science and technology. The book also includes several appendices that provide useful data and tables on thin film materials and properties.
 
One of the limitations of the book is its age, as it was published more than 50 years ago. Therefore, some of the information and references in the book may be outdated or obsolete, especially in the fast-changing fields of thin film technology and applications. The book also does not cover some of the recent developments and advances in thin film research, such as nanoscale thin films, organic thin films, self-assembled monolayers, atomic layer deposition, and molecular beam epitaxy. The book also does not address some of the environmental and social issues related to thin film production and use, such as energy consumption, waste generation, toxicity, and recycling.
 
Overall, Thin Film Phenomena by Kasturi L. Chopra is a classic and comprehensive textbook on thin film science and technology that provides a solid foundation for students and researchers who want to learn about this important and fascinating field. The book is also a valuable reference for professionals who work with thin films in various industries and applications. The book is a testament to the author's expertise and contribution to the field of thin film research.
