## Step 1: Read the dump with any bootloader that supports the control unit you need.
 
You need to read the dump from the ECU with a suitable programmer. The dump is a file that contains the data from the memory chip of the ECU. You can use any bootloader that supports the control unit you need, such as UPA-USB, WELLON Series VP/GP, Galep, Serial and many other (not supplied with the software). Make sure you save the dump file in a safe place.
 
## Step 2: Open the Flash file read from the vehicle control unit.
 
After you have read the dump file from the ECU, you need to open it with IMMO Universal Decoding 3.2. The software has a user-friendly interface that helps you identify the memory to read. You can also use the button Mask to identify a memory catalogued in accordance to standard Bosch and Motorola[^3^].
 
## Step 3: Process the file in the program.
 
Once you have opened the dump file in IMMO Universal Decoding 3.2, you can process it in the program. The software will automatically detect the type of ECU and IMMO system and show you the options available. You can choose to make virgin the IMMO in order to recode, according to the value of original key, or to delete definitively[^1^]. The software will also show you a preview of the modified file before saving it.
 
## Step 4: Load the dump with the same bootloader back into the control unit.
 
After you have processed the file in IMMO Universal Decoding 3.2, you need to load it back into the ECU with the same bootloader that you used to read it. This will overwrite the original IMMO code and replace it with a new one or remove it completely. You can then test if your car starts normally without any problems.
