Fake discs often have a solid black ring or no ring at all.
 
A third way to verify the authenticity of NGC - Super Mario Sunshine [JPN] 270 is to compare it with a regular Japanese version of Super Mario Sunshine.

By following these steps, you can avoid falling for fake or counterfeit copies of NGC - Super Mario Sunshine [JPN] 270. However, you should always be careful when buying or selling rare games online, as some sellers may use deceptive photos or descriptions to trick buyers.
